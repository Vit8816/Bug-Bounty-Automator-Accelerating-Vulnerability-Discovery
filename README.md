# Bug Bounty Automator: Accelerate Vulnerability Discovery

## Introduction
Bug Bounty Automator is a Python script designed to automate vulnerability discovery by testing web applications for SQL Injection (SQLi) and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. It uses a variety of payloads to test inputs and generates detailed reports for analysis.

## Features
- **SQL Injection (SQLi) Testing:** Includes a comprehensive list of SQLi payloads to test various SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Testing:** Utilizes payloads to detect XSS vulnerabilities in different contexts.
- **Automatic Report Generation:** Generates detailed reports highlighting potential vulnerabilities found during testing.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `requests` library
- `beautifulsoup4` library

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vit8816/Bug-Bounty-Automator-Accelerating-Vulnerability-Discovery
   cd Bug-Bounty-Automator
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
3. Run the script:
  ```bash
  python automate_bounty.py
  ```

4. Follow the instructions to input the target URL and choose the type of vulnerability to test (SQLi or XSS).

5. View the generated report in the `results` directory.

## SQL Injection (SQLi) Payloads
- The script includes a full range of SQL injection payloads to test different types of SQL injection vulnerabilities.

## Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Payloads
- The script includes payloads to test various XSS vectors in different contexts (e.g., HTML attributes, script tags).

## Disclaimer
This script is intended for educational purposes and should only be used on web applications where you have permission to conduct testing. Unauthorized use of this script on websites without permission is illegal.
